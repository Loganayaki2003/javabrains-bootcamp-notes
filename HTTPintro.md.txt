The front end and back end communicate with each other using a variety of techniques, such as HTTP requests and responses. When a user interacts with a front-end feature of the website, such as a form submission, it sends an HTTP request to the server, the back-end, which then processes the data, interacts with the database if needed, and sends a response back to the front-end to be displayed to the user.
